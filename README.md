# util_bin
This is a collection of command-line utilities that I have specifically written for Windows' Command Prompt.
Regardless, the code should be portable to Linux and macOS, at least to some degree.

If you think any of these utilities would be useful to you, feel free to pull the repo and build them as
you see fit.

Note that some of the math-centric utilities require MPIR to build correctly.
