all:
    - Ensure the variable and method names make sense.
    - Add other compilation options (Makefiles, GCC/G++, Clang, etc.)
    - Make tests for each utility

die_roll, factor, math_utils/prime_test, num_gen, weasel, word
    - Find a viable C PRNG library (or write your own :) ) and use this in place
      of <random>.
    - Consequently, convert these utilities to C once the above library is
      found/written.

factor
    - For factor_c: build or find a viable alternative to std::map for C (an
      associative array or hash table would work best).
