Setting up the util_bin directory is very simple:
    1. Copy the folder to a place of your choice (Ex: in C:\)
    2. Add the following to your user PATH (or the system PATH, if desired):
           <ROOT PATH>\util_bin
           <ROOT PATH>\util_bin\bzip2-1.0.5-bin\bin
           <ROOT PATH>\util_bin\Coreinfo
           <ROOT PATH>\util_bin\cpu-z_1.80-en
           <ROOT PATH>\util_bin\hwmonitor_1.32
           <ROOT PATH>\util_bin\vim\vim80
       where <ROOT PATH> designates where you copied the folder.

Once this is done, you can use all included executables via the Command Prompt or
PowerShell.
